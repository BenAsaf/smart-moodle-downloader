## Contributing
This extension was written and tested for Hebrew University's 2019 Moodle (https://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il). We try to
support other versions of Moodle as well so if you happen to use a version that doesn't seem to be supported or have any bugs/features to report please open an issue.
